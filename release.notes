[rel-v1r4]

NEW: A image can have different bootImageName and Flavor depending in the cloud endpoint
NEW: Try to halt a VM when declared Stalled, if success then go Halt status
Several bugfixes, particularly of interest is:
    FIX: UniqueID up to 255 VARCHAR
    requires a VirtualMachine_DB update to the field size

[v1r3]
NEW: Cloudinit contextualization for Amazon EC2 using boto API.
CHANGE: AmazonImage and AmazonInstance has changed to the same design as openstack and opennebula, using Utilitites/configuration.py and contextualization.py

[v1r1]
NEW: Cloudinit generic contextualization, a single context method, machinery and scripts, for all your cloud managers.
VMDIRAC v1r1 provides an enterprise contextualization method, based in a golden image with cloudinit installed, and some automatic scripts for each cloud endpoint and DIRAC image to run a VM. 
Supported cloudmangers for cloudinit with DIRAC:
OpenNebula 4.6.1 (client installation in VMDIRAC server: rocci client 4.2.5)
Openstack Grizzly (API installation in VMDIRAC server: apache-libcloud-0.14.0-beta3)

[v0r9]

NEW: Amiconfig support for metadata
NEW: StratusLab code added

[v0r8]
NEW: rOCCI 1.1 DIRAC driver. 
     rOCCI authentication by X509 proxies with third-party VOMS (rOCCI do the matching work in a transparent manner)
     Generic contextualization by SSH (Generic to all Operating System Images and Cloud Managers, software convergence) Currently SSH contextualization available for OpenNebula and OpenStack.
NEW: VM local dirac.cfg updater agent for pilot/dirac release is updated
CHANGE: OcciImage and Occi09 migrated to new WMS/Utilities style
TODO: OCCI 1.1 for openstack if no rOCCI available

[v0r7]
NEW: endpoint vmPolicy "static" -> slots driven, indicated by maxEndpointInstances, endpoint CS parameter
     endpoint vmPolicy "elastic" -> jobs driven, one by one

NEW: endpoint vmStopPolicy "never" 
     endpoint vmStopPolicy "elastic" -> no more jobs + VM halting margin time
CHANGE: Both cases: VMs can be stoped from "Instances Overview" screen: VirtualMachineDB.py in function instanceIDHeartBeat:
					 Send empty dir just in case we want to send flags (such as stop vm)
TODO: The particular HEPiX method to ask VMs to shootdown from the IaaS site provider site (requirement to be specified by HEPiX)

[v0r6]

NEW: nova-1.1 driver and ssh contextualization method, ready to extend to amiconfig contextualization.

[v0r5]

Multi-endpoint OpenNebula and CloudStack in a fed way. Running-pads, DIRAC-Images and Endpoints scheme.

[v0r4]

FIX: Added missing occi and cloud director files

[v0r3]

NEW: Redesign of VMDirector to allow for more Cloud provider drivers without modifications to the VM core components.
NEW: An image is componed of a bootstrap image and context files. Optionally a context image can be included also.
CHANGE: A CS Cloud Endpoint has all the contextualization and configuration parameters for a specific endpoint
CHANGE: A running Pod contains a DIRAC image, a list of endpoings and the necessary parameters and requirements.

[v0r2]

Initial version of VMDIRAC. It includes support for Occi and Amazon clouds.
